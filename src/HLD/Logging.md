# üîç Observability in Distributed Systems

Modern distributed systems (like a **Payment Service**) rely on the **three pillars of observability**:  

1. **Logging (ELK Stack: Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)**  
2. **Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana)**  
3. **Tracing (Jaeger / OpenTelemetry)**  

These tools together help in debugging, monitoring, and ensuring system reliability.

## üìñ Comparison Table

| Feature              | ELK (Logging)                                      | Prometheus + Grafana (Metrics)                         | Jaeger (Tracing)                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Centralized logging & search                       | Metrics collection, monitoring, and alerting          | Distributed request tracing                 |
| **Data Type**        | Unstructured/semi-structured logs (JSON, text)     | Time-series numeric data (counts, latency, CPU, etc.) | End-to-end request spans & traces           |
| **Storage**          | Elasticsearch (index-based)                        | Prometheus TSDB                                        | Jaeger backend (Cassandra, Elasticsearch)   |
| **Visualization**    | Kibana dashboards                                  | Grafana dashboards & alerts                           | Jaeger UI (timeline + service graph)        |
| **Best For**         | Debugging issues, detailed error analysis          | Monitoring health, SLA tracking, alerting             | Root cause of latency across microservices  |
| **Limitations**      | High storage cost, not real-time analytics         | Not for logs, only numeric metrics                    | Overhead if tracing every request           |

## üìù Example: Payment Service

### 1. ELK (Logging)
**Log stored in Elasticsearch:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-18T12:30:45Z",
  "service": "PaymentService",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "txnId": "TXN12345",
  "userId": "U6789",
  "error": "BankAPI timeout after 30s",
  "statusCode": 504
}
````

**Kibana Query (KQL):**

```
service: "PaymentService" AND level: "ERROR" AND statusCode: 504
```

üëâ Returns all timeout errors in PaymentService.

---

### 2. Prometheus + Grafana (Metrics)

**Prometheus Metrics (scraped at /metrics):**

```
payment_service_request_latency_seconds{method="POST"} 0.45
payment_failures_total{error="timeout"} 57
```

**Grafana Dashboards:**

* Average latency per API call.
* Error rate % over last 15 minutes.
* Alerts ‚Üí Slack/Email if error rate > 5%.

---

### 3. Jaeger (Tracing)

**Trace for Transaction TXN12345:**

* API Gateway ‚Üí 50ms
* Auth Service ‚Üí 80ms
* Payment Service ‚Üí 200ms
* Bank API ‚Üí 900ms (‚ö† bottleneck)
* Notification Service ‚Üí 30ms

**Jaeger UI Timeline:**

* Visualizes the entire request path.
* Shows **Bank API** is slowing down payments.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Each Works Together

* **ELK (Logs):** What happened? (e.g., error details, stack trace)
* **Prometheus + Grafana (Metrics):** How is the system behaving? (e.g., latency, error % trend)
* **Jaeger (Tracing):** Where is the problem? (e.g., which microservice caused delay)

üëâ Together, they provide **full observability**.

## ‚úÖ Interview-Friendly Summary

*"In a distributed Payment Service, we use ELK for logging, Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, and Jaeger for tracing. For example, if payments are failing, ELK shows exact error logs, Prometheus shows rising error rate and latency in dashboards, and Jaeger shows that Bank API is the bottleneck. This combination ensures quick root cause analysis and proactive monitoring."*
