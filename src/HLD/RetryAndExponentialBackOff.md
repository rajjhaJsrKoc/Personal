# 🔁 Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff

## 1. Why Do We Need Retries?
In distributed systems (like payment gateways, billers, bank APIs):  
- Calls may fail due to **network glitches, timeouts, or temporary unavailability**.  
- Instead of failing immediately, the client **retries** the request.  

👉 Example: If biller API doesn’t respond, retry again after some time.  

---

## 2. The Problem with Simple Retries
If we retry immediately (or at a fixed interval):  
- Many clients retry **at the same time**, leading to a **retry storm**.  
- This makes the downstream system even slower (**thundering herd problem**).  

---

## 3. Exponential Backoff
Instead of retrying at a fixed rate, **wait time grows exponentially** after each failure.  

### Formula:
```

wait\_time = base\_delay \* (2 ^ retry\_attempt)

````

Example (base_delay = 1s, max 5 retries):  
- 1st retry → 1s  
- 2nd retry → 2s  
- 3rd retry → 4s  
- 4th retry → 8s  
- 5th retry → 16s  

👉 This gives the downstream service **time to recover**.  

---

## 4. Jitter (Randomization)
To avoid synchronized retries from thousands of clients:  
- Add a **random jitter** to backoff.  

Example: Instead of always waiting 8s, wait **7–9s randomly**.  

---

## 5. Payment Service Example
Suppose payment API call to bank fails due to network timeout:  
1. First retry after **1s**.  
2. If still failing, retry after **2s**.  
3. Next after **4s**, then **8s**, then **16s** (max retries reached).  
4. If still failing → mark payment as **PENDING/FAILED** and move to async reconciliation job.  

---

## 6. Benefits
- Prevents overwhelming external systems.  
- Balances reliability with performance.  
- Ensures temporary glitches don’t cause permanent failures.  

---

## 7. Pseudocode Example (Java)
```java
int maxRetries = 5;
int baseDelay = 1000; // in ms

for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
        callPaymentAPI();
        break; // success
    } catch (Exception e) {
        if (attempt == maxRetries) {
            throw e; // fail after max retries
        }
        long waitTime = baseDelay * (long) Math.pow(2, attempt);
        // Add jitter
        waitTime += new Random().nextInt(500);
        Thread.sleep(waitTime);
    }
}
````

## ✅ Interview Answer

*"Retry with exponential backoff means that instead of retrying requests at a fixed interval, we exponentially increase the wait time between retries. This prevents overloading downstream services and allows them to recover. In payments, we combine exponential backoff with jitter and a max retry limit, and if retries still fail, we hand off to an async reconciliation process."*
